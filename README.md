## TODO
Things to do when first branching the base repository.

- Refactor home controller and services to new package name.
- Change base users' passwords.
- Search all files for SingleTenantBase and change to new app name.
- Add any number of codeNarc properties into grails-app/conf/BuildConfig.groovy. For example, you can configure one or more reprots using codenarc.reports property as follows

```
codenarc.reports = {
    // generate xml report
	MyXmlReport('xml') {
		outputFile = 'target/CodeNarcReport.xml'  // Set the 'outputFile' property of the (XML) Report
		title = 'SingleTenantBase XML Report'             // Set the 'title' property of the (XML) Report
	}
	// generate html report
		MyHtmlReport('html') {
		outputFile = 'target/CodeNarcReport.html'
		title = 'SingleTenantBase html Report'
	}
}
```

### Searchable

The **Searchable** plugin is a powerful way to perform free text search on domain objects. Below are instructions to configure STB for search:

- Add `static searchable  = { mapping { spellCheck "include" } }` to searchable domain objects.
- Overwrite the default `toString()` method on searchable domain objects, this will be the title of the element when returned by a search query
	- **Make sure that any fields and objects used in the `toString()` method are also searchable otherwise they will not be included in the Searchable index**
- Add a `Collection<String> highlight()` method to the searchable domain objects which returnes a collection of all fields you want highlighted if they contain the search term (e.g. name, description)

## Disconnecting and Pushing a New Project to GitHub
This section describes the steps to disconnect a modified SingleTenantBase project from source control and pushing it as a new project to GitHub.

- Pull down SingleTenantBase from GitHub.
- Modify it according to the **TODO** section above.
- Create a new repository on GitHub with the new project name
- Right click on the project in 'Project Explorer' -> Team -> Show in Repository View
- Right click on the project in 'Git Repository' -> Delete Repository -> Only select 'Delete Git Data and History'
- Right click on the project in 'Project Explorer' -> Team -> Disconnect
- Right click on the project in 'Project Explorer' -> Delete -> Leave 'Delete project contents...' **unchecked** -> OK
- Find the project in your file system -> Rename the folder to the new project name
- File -> Import -> Grails -> Grails Project -> Find the newly renamed folder -> Finish
- Right click on the project in 'Project Explorer' -> Team -> Share Project -> Git -> Make sure the checkbox at the top is checked -> Click on the project -> Create Repository -> Finish
- Right click on the project in 'Project Explorer' -> Team -> Commit -> Write a commit message and select all files -> Commit
